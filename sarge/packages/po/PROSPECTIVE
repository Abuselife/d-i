# The languages listed here are "prospective"
# The translations contained in PO files will NOT
# be spread over the packages
#
# This is meant for getting more control about which
# languages are included in a release
#
# Languages without supported locales in Debian should
# stay here until at least one locale really exists

# bubulle 12/02/2004 : the languages below have been REMOVED
#                      from the sarge branch
#                      The entries may probably be removed
#                      but I'm keping them just in case
